# landing-page
This is my version of the Landing Page project, as per the Odin Project's curriculum,
I will recreate it to the best of my ability. It should end up looking a bit goofy 
since I made it in essentially 8:9 (half of my screen) since the landing page image 
looked to be in that aspect ratio given the font sizes we're working with.
